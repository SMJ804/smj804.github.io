		<h2>Gravitation</h2>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>How gravitational force depends on the position of two bodiues under consideration? <br><p>Asnwer: We know Gravitational force $$ F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} $$ that is the force depends on the square of distance between them.<p> </li>
				<li>A body falls in the gravitational field of the earth. Show that its acceleration is independent of its mass <p> Answer: Gravitational force $$ F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} $$ We know \( F = ma \) so $$ ma = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$ or $$ a = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$ thus we can see that acceration due to gravity does not depend on the mass of the falling body.</p>  </li>
				<li>Can a particle experiance torque due to the central force? comment.<p>Answer: No central force cannot excet torque on a body as torque\( \tau = r \times F = rFsin( \theta ) \). For a central force \( \theta = 180 \) along the radius i.e \( sin(\theta) = 0\) </li>
				<li> Prove that a particle moving under the action of a central force has a constant angular momentum. <p>Answer: Angular momentum \( l = r \times P \) where P is the linear momentum. i.e $$\frac{dl}{dt} = \frac{d(r \times P)}{dt} = r \times F$$ In case of central force \( F = f(r)\^r\)  $$\frac{dl}{dt} = r\^r \times f(r)\^r = r(f(r)(\^r \times \^r) = 0$$ $$\frac{dl}{dt} = 0$$ That is angular momentum remains constant</p> </li>
				<li> What are centrall forces? Why is that a particle acted upon by a central force moves in a plane? <p> Answer Any force that is directed towasrs or away from a fixed point and whose magnitude iss a function only of the ddistance to the fixed point is called a central force. At any instant the particle in the plane is definec by the position vector and velocity vector. the only way the particle moves out of this plane is if it has an acceleration whose component is perpendicular to the plane. But for central force the force and acceleration lie along the radius in the direction \( \^r or - \^r \)</p></li>
				<li> Determine the gravitational potential at a point outside of a spherical shell of mass M and radius a. Refer figure given </li>
				<li> Obtain the equation of motion for a planet. <p>Answer: To get equation of motion using lagrangian we need T and V<br>\(T=\frac{1}{2}mv^@ + \frac{1}{2}mr^2\omega^2 = \frac{1}{2}m\.{r}^2 + \frac{1}[{2}mr^2\.{\theta}^2\)<br>\(V = -\frac{GMm}{r}\)<br>Lagrangian$$L=T-V =\frac{1}{2}mv^@ + \frac{1}{2}mr^2\omega^2 = \frac{1}{2}m\.{r}^2 + \frac{1}[{2}mr^2\.\theta^2 + \frac{GMm}{r}$$ First equation of motion$$\frac{d(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \.r})}{dt} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial r} = 0$$ $$m\"r - mr\.\theta^2 + \frac{GMm}{r^2} = 0$$ Second Equation of motion $$\frac{d(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \.\theta})}{dt} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$$ $$\frac{d(mr^2\.\theta)}{dt} = 0$$ i.e $$\frac{dl}{dt} = 0$$ since \(mr^2\.\theta = l\) also \( \.\theta = \frac{l}{mr^2}\) So Equation of motion is $$\"r - \frac{l^2}{m^2r^3}+\frac{GMm}{r^2} = 0$$</p></li>
				<li> What effect does the distance between two bodies have on its gravitational force?<p>Asnwer: We know Gravitational force $$ F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} $$ that is the force depends on the square of distance between them. more separation distance will result in weaker gravitational forces.</p> </li>
				<li>A body falls in the gravitational field of the earth. Show that its acceleration is independent of its mass <p> Answer: Gravitational force $$ F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} $$ We know \( F = ma \) so $$ ma = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$ or $$ a = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$ thus we can see that acceration due to gravity depends only on mass of earth and not on the mass of the body.</li>
				<li>Explain Newton's Law of gravitation. Why is it called univesal?<p> Answer: statement that any particle of matter in the universe attracts any other with a force varying directly as the product of the masses and inversely as the square of the distance between them. or $$F=\frac{GMm}{r^2}$$ Newton’s law of gravity is considered “universal” because it is believed to be applicable to the entire Universe. It is called so because it is applicable on all bodies having mass(like the sun, moon, earth or an apple) and the bodies will be governed by the same law, that is newton's law of gravitation. Newton's law of gravitation is valid anywhere in the universe irrespective of the size and shape of the object. Thus, as it is applicable universally, it is called as universal law.</p></li>
				<li>Explain Keplers laws<p>Answer:Kepler's laws help to understand the planetary motion of satellites, Elucidate Kepler's laws of planetary motion</p><h5>The Law of Orbits</h5><p>All the planets revolve around the sun in elliptical orbits having the sun at one of the focii</p><h5>The Law of Equal Areas</h5><p>The radius vector drawn from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time</p><h5>The Law of Periods</h5><p>The square of the time period of revolution of a planet around the sun in an elliptical orbit is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis $$T^2 \propto a^3$$</p></li>
				<li>Show that for a planetary motion, kinetic energy = \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}mr^2\omega^2 \)</li>
				<li>Evaluate the angular momentum of a particle moving in a circular orbit under the influence of an attractive central force which is inversly proportional to \( r^3 \).<p>Answer : By Newton's second law, \( mr&#776 \ = -f(r)r&#770 = -\frac{k}{r^3} \) Recall from oru discussion of plane polar coordinate that acceleration in polar coordinate is \( \ddot{r} = (\ddot{r}-r\dot{\theta}^2)\hat{r} + (\ddot{r} + 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta})\hat{\theta} \)<br> For a circulat orbi, the magnitude (\ r\) is constant so \( \dot{r} = 0\) and \( \ddot{r} = 0\) so $$m\ddot{r} = m(-r\dot{\theta}^2\hat{r} + r\ddot{\theta}\hat{\theta}) = f(r)\hat{r} $$ Therefore, for an inverse cube force \(m\ddot{r} = -f(r)\hat{r}\) yeilds two relations, namely $$-mr\dot{\theta}^2 = -f(r)=\frac{k}{r^3}$$ and $$mr\ddot{\theta}=0$$The second equation boils down to \( \ddot{\theta} = 0\) telling us that the angular velocity \( \dot{\theta} \) is constant. The first equation yields $$ mr^4\dot{\theta}^2 = k$$ But because \( l = mr^2\dot{\theta}\) we see that the lhs is \( \frac{l^2}{m}\) and consequently $$l^2 = mk$$ and hence the angular momentum is constant</p></li>
