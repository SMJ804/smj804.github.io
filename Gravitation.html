		<h2>Gravitation</h2>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>How gravitational force depends on the position of two bodiues under consideration? <br><p>Asnwer: We know Gravitational force $$ F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} $$ that is the force depends on the square of distance between them.<p> </li>
				<li>A body falls in the gravitational field of the earth. Show that its acceleration is independent of its mass <p> Answer: Gravitational force $$ F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} $$ We know \( F = ma \) so $$ ma = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$ or $$ a = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$ thus we can see that acceration due to gravity does not depend on the mass of the falling body.</p>  </li>
				<li>Can a particle experiance torque due to the central force? comment.<p>Answer: No central force cannot excet torque on a body as torque\( \tau = r \times F = rFsin( \theta ) \). For a central force \( \theta = 180 \) along the radius i.e \( sin(\theta) = 0\) </li>
				<li> Prove that a particle moving under the action of a central force has a constant angular momentum. </li>
				<li> What are centrall forces? Why is that a particle acted upon by a central force moves in a plane?</li>
				<li> Determine the gravitational potential at a point outside of a spherical shell of mass M and radius a. Refer figure given</li>
				<li> Prove that the equation of motion of a planet of mass m attached gravitaionally to another body of mass M is \( \"{r} \) .................</li>
				<li> What effect does the distance between two bodies have on its gravitational force?</li>
				<li>Explain Newton's Law of gravitation. Why is it called univesal?</li>
				<li>Explain Keplers laws</li>
				<li>Show that for a planetary motion, kinetic energy = \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}mr^2\omega^2 \)</li>
				<li> Evaluate the angular momentum of a particle moving in a circular orbit under the influence of an attractive central force which is inversly proportional to \( r^3 \).</li>
				<li> Deduce the curl and divergence of gravitational field (▽*g and ▽.g) and prove that source of gravitational field is the mass density ρ.</li>
				<li>Explain the concept of gravitational field of an extended body and derive a relation for obtaining the field at any arbitrary point.</li>
				<li> A string of length L and with linear density λ mass per unit length lies along the x axis. The end points of the string are at x = 0 and x = L. Assume the string can be represented as a linear mass distribution- it has no thickness . Determine the gravitational field at the point x = 4L.</li>
				<li>Using Gauss's law, explain how the gravitational field of a point mass can be determined?</li>
				<li>A particle is in a circular orbit under the action of an attractive central force given by f(r) = -k/r3. Obtain an expression for the angular momentum and show that it is constant.</li>
				<li>Discuss the concept of gravitational field and potential.</li>
				<li>Obtain the equation of motion for a planet.</li>
