		<h2>Gravitation</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>How gravitational force depends on the position of two bodiues under consideration? <br><p>Asnwer: We know Gravitational force $$ F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} $$ that is the force depends on the square of distance between them.<p> </li>
				<li>A body falls in the gravitational field of the earth. Show that its acceleration is independent of its mass <p> Answer: Gravitational force $$ F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} $$ We know \( F = ma \) so $$ ma = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$ or $$ a = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$ thus we can see that acceration due to gravity does not depend on the mass of the falling body.</p>  </li>
				<li>Can a particle experiance torque due to the central force? comment.<p>Answer: No central force cannot excet torque on a body as torque\( \tau = r \times F = rFsin( \theta ) \). For a central force \( \theta = 180 \) along the radius i.e \( sin(\theta) = 0\) </li>
				<li> Prove that a particle moving under the action of a central force has a constant angular momentum. <p>Answer: Angular momentum \( l = r \times P \) where P is the linear momentum. i.e $$\frac{dl}{dt} = \frac{d(r \times P)}{dt} = r \times F$$ In case of central force \( F = f(r)\^r\)  $$\frac{dl}{dt} = r\^r \times f(r)\^r = r(f(r)(\^r \times \^r) = 0$$ $$\frac{dl}{dt} = 0$$ That is angular momentum remains constant</p> </li>
				<li> What are centrall forces? Why is that a particle acted upon by a central force moves in a plane? <p> Answer Any force that is directed towasrs or away from a fixed point and whose magnitude iss a function only of the ddistance to the fixed point is called a central force. At any instant the particle in the plane is definec by the position vector and velocity vector. the only way the particle moves out of this plane is if it has an acceleration whose component is perpendicular to the plane. But for central force the force and acceleration lie along the radius in the direction \( \^r or - \^r \)</p></li>
				<li> Determine the gravitational potential at a point outside of a spherical shell of mass M and radius a. Refer figure given </li>
				<li> Prove that the equation of motion of a planet of mass m attached gravitaionally to another body of mass M is \( \"{r} \) ................. <p>Answer: To get equation of motion using lagrangian we need T and V<br>\(T=\frac{1}{2}mv^@ + \frac{1}{2}mr^2\omega^2 = \frac{1}{2}m\.{r}^2 + \frac{1}[{2}mr^2\.\theta^2\)<br>\(V = -\frac{GMm}{r}\)<br>Lagrangian$$L=T-V =\frac{1}{2}mv^@ + \frac{1}{2}mr^2\omega^2 = \frac{1}{2}m\.{r}^2 + \frac{1}[{2}mr^2\.\theta^2 + \frac{GMm}{r}$$ First equation of motion$$\frac{d(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \.r})}{dt} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial r} = 0$$ $$m\"r - mr\.\theta^2 + \frac{GMm}{r^2} = 0$$ Second Equation of motion $$\frac{d(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \.\theta})}{dt} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$$ $$\frac{d(mr^2\.\theta)}{dt} = 0$$ i.e $$\frac{dl}{dt} = 0$$ since \(mr^2\.\theta = l\) also \( \.\theta = \frac{l}{mr^2}\) So Equation of motion is $$\"r - \frac{l^2}{m^2r^3}+\frac{GMm}{r^2} = 0$$</p></li>
				<li> What effect does the distance between two bodies have on its gravitational force?<p>Asnwer: We know Gravitational force $$ F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} $$ that is the force depends on the square of distance between them. more separation distance will result in weaker gravitational forces.<p> </li>
				<li>A body falls in the gravitational field of the earth. Show that its acceleration is independent of its mass <p> Answer: Gravitational force $$ F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} $$ We know \( F = ma \) so $$ ma = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$ or $$ a = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$ thus we can see that acceration due to gravity depends on the .</li>
				<li>Explain Newton's Law of gravitation. Why is it called univesal?</li>
				<li>Explain Keplers laws</li>
				<li>Show that for a planetary motion, kinetic energy = \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}mr^2\omega^2 \)</li>
				<li> Evaluate the angular momentum of a particle moving in a circular orbit under the influence of an attractive central force which is inversly proportional to \( r^3 \).</li>
				<li> Deduce the curl and divergence of gravitational field (▽*g and ▽.g) and prove that source of gravitational field is the mass density ρ.</li>
				<li>Explain the concept of gravitational field of an extended body and derive a relation for obtaining the field at any arbitrary point.</li>
				<li> A string of length L and with linear density λ mass per unit length lies along the x axis. The end points of the string are at x = 0 and x = L. Assume the string can be represented as a linear mass distribution- it has no thickness . Determine the gravitational field at the point x = 4L.</li>
				<li>Using Gauss's law, explain how the gravitational field of a point mass can be determined?</li>
				<li>A particle is in a circular orbit under the action of an attractive central force given by f(r) = -k/r3. Obtain an expression for the angular momentum and show that it is constant.</li>

				<li>Obtain the equation of motion for a planet.</li>
